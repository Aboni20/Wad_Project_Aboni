                <h3>Hi,</h3>
                <h1>I'm <span>Irfat Nur Aboni</span> </h1>
                <p>A highly motivated and dedicated individual with a profound interest
                    in the tech and entertainment industry, I possess a comprehensive
                    background in co-curricular activities that demonstrate exceptional
                    communication, leadership, and innovative prowess. I have actively
                    participated in co-curricular activities since my school days, including
                    debates, presentations, and science fairs. Through these activities, I
                    have developed and refined my skills in communication, leadership,
                    and innovation. I gained valuable experience working with various
                    organizations such as Garena, NDF BD, Higgsino Science Society,
                    Protiti Bitorko Songho, etc., where I successfully organized and
                    executed events. Previously, I served as an Affiliate Coordinator in the
                    affiliation (sales) team at 10 Minute School. I was also actively
                    involved as a Community Moderator for Garena Free Fire, where I
                    contributed to the success of the organization and further improved
                    my communication and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I had the
                    opportunity to study as an Erasmus+ exchange student in Sweden,
                    which further enriched my cultural understanding and adaptability in a
                    global context.
